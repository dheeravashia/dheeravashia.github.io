                <h3> <a href="https://github.com/dheeravashia/dheeravashia.github.io/blob/main/Overconfidence%20and%20Shocks.pdf"> Economics Thesis (Hons.) </a></h3>
                <h4>Economics Department, University Of The South, Sewanee TN ​| Economics Department, University Of Arizona, Tucson AZ | August 2022 - present</h4>
                <p> 
                I am fascinated by the decision-making framework proposed by <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/thinkers/economics/daniel-kahneman">Khaneman and Trvskey</a> in the late 1900s. In this research project, I 
                specifically look at the empirical prevalence of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028573900339"> availability heuristic </a>and whether it can explain the disparity between subjective and objective financial knowledge (overconfidence). 
                Financial knowledge overconfidence, specifically subjective knowledge, is a significant predictor of financial decisions. The overall idea is that if the availability heuristic holds we would expect individuals who have experienced higher stochastic financial shocks to have lower levels of overconfidence, all else constant. This project extended to my graduate school from my undergraduate senior thesis. 
                This research propelled my interest in looking at learning costs (which can be thought of as costs related to attention and cognition) and individual decisions of knowledge updation, which I am currently thinking about modeling in both a static and dynamic environment.
